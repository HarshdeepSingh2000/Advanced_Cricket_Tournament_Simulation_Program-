To run the advanced cricket tournament simulation program, you can follow these steps:

1-Open a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) on your computer.
2-Create a new Python file and give it a suitable name, such as "cricket_tournament_simulation.py".
3-Copy the code provided for the Player, Team, Field, Outcome, Umpire, and Match classes into your Python file.
4-Save the file.
5-At the top of your Python file, import the necessary modules or classes. For example:

import random

6-Write the code to set up the tournament and start the match. For example:

# Create players
player1 = Player("MS Dhoni", 0.2, 0.8, 0.99, 0.8, 0.9)
player2 = Player("Virat Kohli", 0.3, 0.9, 0.95, 0.7, 0.95)
player3 = Player("Rohit Sharma", 0.2, 0.85, 0.9, 0.75, 0.85)

# Create teams
team1 = Team("Team A", [player1, player2, player3])
team2 = Team("Team B", [player1, player2, player3])

# Create field
field = Field()

# Create umpire
umpire = Umpire(field)

# Create match
match = Match(team1, team2, umpire)

# Start the match
match.start_match()


7-Save the file and run it using a Python interpreter. You can do this by opening a terminal or command prompt, navigating to the directory where your Python file is saved, and running the command

python cricket_tournament_simulation.py


8-Observe the output in the console, which will display the simulated cricket match with commentary and match statistics.
Feel free to customize the player names, stats, teams, and any other aspects of the simulation to suit your requirements.
